			<h2 class="grey_text">Summary</h2>
			<p>
				I have been developing software for over 10 years. I developed a passion for it when I was in my teenage years,
				and over the next 15 years I have, in one form or another, developed websites and web applications
				continuously. I began developing websites for family, friends, and eventually evolved into commercial
				software development. I am currently employed as software developer, and I spend about 10 hours a day
				completely immersed. My goal is to take the knowledge that I have acquired and use it to create a software
				development firm that will be the benchmark for software companies of the future
